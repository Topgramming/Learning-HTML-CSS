# Learning-HTML-CSS
This is where I store everything I learn, my notes and my projects.

The first project I made is a basic website using the things I've learned in this tutorial, I used my own notes to remind myself of some details, there is a little CSS part which I googled because the table was horrendous.
If you are learning as well, what works for me is having clear what you want to do so that Google can help you.

Some links will take you to my shopify ecommerce store just cause.
I learned to commit a change
