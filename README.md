# Learning-HTML-CSS
This is where I store everything I learn, my notes and my projects.

The first project I made is a basic website using the things I've learned in this tutorial, I used my own notes to remind myself of some details, there is a little CSS part which I googled because the table was horrendous.
If you are learning as well, what works for me is having clear what you want to do so that Google can help you.
